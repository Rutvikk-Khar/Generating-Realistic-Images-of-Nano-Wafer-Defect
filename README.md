# Generating-Realistic-Images-of-Nano-Wafer-Defect
This repository consists of an ML approach for generating realistic Wafer Defect Generation using GANs and VAE and the ablation study between the two models.

## Repository Guide:
- The GAN-based model is enclosed in the folder "GAN"
- The VAE-based model and the ablation study against GAN model are enclosed in the folder "VAE_and_Ablation"

These folders contain the Word document with instructions, results, and the working code.
